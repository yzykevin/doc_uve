# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
# Use separate configuration files for each language:
# - conf_en.py for English (default)
# - conf_cn.py for Chinese
#
# To build both languages, you have TWO options:
#
# OPTION 1: Two separate Read the Docs projects (Recommended)
#   1. Create a new project on RTD for the Chinese version
#   2. Set the configuration file to docs/conf_cn.py
#   3. Set the project language to Chinese (zh_CN)
#   4. In the English project's Translations settings, add the Chinese project
#
# OPTION 2: Use versions
#   Create separate versions in RTD and configure each to use different conf files

sphinx:
   configuration: docs/conf_en.py

# Optionally, but recommended,
# declare the Python requirements required to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
python:
   install:
   - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
